# Data Visualization

## Assignment 4: Final Project

### Requirements:
- We will finish this class by giving you the chance to use what you have learned in a practical context, by creating data visualizations from raw data. 
- Choose a dataset of interest from the [City of Torontoâ€™s Open Data Portal](https://www.toronto.ca/city-government/data-research-maps/open-data/) or [Ontarioâ€™s Open Data Catalogue](https://data.ontario.ca/). 
- Using Python and one other data visualization software (Excel or free alternative, Tableau Public, any other tool you prefer), create two distinct visualizations from your dataset of choice.<br> 

Visualization 1 (Bar Chart):<br>
![Bar Chart](a4_barchart.png)<br>
Data Source: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-crime-rates/

Visualization 2 (Bubble Chart):<br>
![Bubble Chart](a4_bubblechart.png)<br>
Data Source: https://open.toronto.ca/dataset/neighbourhood-crime-rates/


- For each visualization, describe and justify: 
    > What software did you use to create your data visualization?<br>
    *A: Google Sheets for data preprocessing and Python for visualization (Matplotlib/Seaborn)*

    > Who is your intended audience?<br>
    *A: The primary audience for this visualization is individuals and organizations concerned with urban safety and crime patterns in Toronto. This includes residents, law enforcement agencies, city planners, and researchers interested in urban studies and criminology.*

    > What information or message are you trying to convey with your visualization?<br>
    *A: The visualization aims to convey the spatial distribution of auto theft incidents across different Toronto districts relative to their population size. By using bubble size to represent the number of auto thefts, the chart highlights areas with higher or lower rates of auto theft compared to their population.*
    
    > What design principles (substantive, perceptual, aesthetic) did you consider when making your visualization? How did you apply these principles? With what elements of your plots?<br>
    *A: Both visualizations accurately reflect the data on auto theft incidents and population for each district.<br>
    - Bar chart: Bar heights effectively represent the relative magnitude of auto thefts.<br>
    - Bubble chart: Bubble size and y-axis position effectively convey the number of auto thefts and population for each district. The y-axis provides numerical values for precise comparison.<br>
    Both visualizations have a clear and uncluttered layout with contrasting colors for enhanced readability and visual appeal.*
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualizations are reproducible? If the tool you used to make your data visualization is not reproducible, how will this impact your data visualization?<br>
    *A: The provided code demonstrates the libraries and steps used to create the visualizations. This transparency significantly improves reproducibility. Anyone with access to the data and these libraries can recreate the visualizations.*
    
    > How did you ensure that your data visualization is accessible?<br>
    - Clear and concise labeling: Both charts feature clear and concise labels for axes, titles, and data points, ensuring easy interpretation.
    - Effective use of color and design: The color palette and overall design enhance readability and visual appeal without compromising accessibility.
    - Appropriate chart types and layout: The choice of bar and bubble charts, combined with effective use of white space, contributes to clear and understandable visualizations.
    
    > Who are the individuals and communities who might be impacted by your visualization?<br>
    *A: These visualizations can impact various individuals and communities:<br>
    - Residents: May experience increased awareness of auto theft rates in their districts.<br>
    - Law enforcement: Can utilize this data to allocate resources and target crime prevention efforts.<br>
    - City planners and policymakers: Can consider this information during urban planning strategies and resource allocation.*

    > How did you choose which features of your chosen dataset to include or exclude from your visualization?<br>
    *A: The visualizations focus on the number of auto thefts in each district and the district population to help citizens determine the best location when considering relocation within Torontoâ€™s districts.*
    
    > What â€˜underwater labourâ€™ contributed to your final data visualization product?<br>
    *A: It involed collecting, aggregating, and preprocessing the data on auto theft incidents for each Toronto district, choosing the appropriate visualization types and designing the layouts, and formatting the chart elements (labels, titles, legends) for clarity and visual appeal.*

- This assignment is intentionally open-ended - you are free to create static or dynamic data visualizations, maps, or whatever form of data visualization you think best communicates your information to your audience of choice! 
- Total word count should not exceed **(as a maximum) 1000 words** 
 
### Why am I doing this assignment?:  
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses the learning outcomes: 
* Create and customize data visualizations from start to finish in Python
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story  
- This would be a great project to include in your GitHub Portfolio â€“ put in the effort to make it something worthy of showing prospective employers!
