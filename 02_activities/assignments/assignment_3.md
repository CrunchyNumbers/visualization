# Data Visualization

## Assignment 3: Data Visualization Ethics

### Requirements:
- Letâ€™s return to the data visualizations we evaluated for Assignment 2.  
- For each visualization: 
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) whether or not you think this data visualization is accessible, reproducible, and equitable. 
        ```
        Example 1 (finance heatmap):
        The heatmap uses color coding to represent performance, making it easy to identify trends at a glance.
        However, reliance on color alone may not be accessible to individuals with color vision deficiencies, and small text can be hard to read. The data appears reproducible with access to the same financial markets, but lacks clarity on the specific data and capture time. The heatmap covers various sectors, offering a comprehensive view but does not address equity directly, omitting smaller firms.

        Example 2 (spending analysis):
        The 3D bars and varied heights make the chart visually engaging but can distort data perception, making comparisons difficult. The small text and Italian language limit accessibility. The spending data is likely sourced from well-documented records, making it theoretically reproducible, but lacks clear references and methodology. The chart covers a range of spending categories but may reflect biases by focusing on prominent brands, overlooking smaller or regional ones.
        ```
    - How could this data visualization have been improved (in terms of accessibility, reproducibility, equity)?  
        ```
        Example 1:
        To improve accessibility for the finance heatmap, I'd advise implementing patterns or textures in addition to color and increase font size or provide zoom options.
        For reproducibility, I'd include a timestamp and source information.
        To enhance equity, I'd recommend incorporating information about smaller companies or alternative investments, and ensure transparent data sources and methodologies.

        Example 2:
        To improve accessibility of the spendings chart, I'd recommend flattening the design to avoid 3D distortion, using larger fonts, and providing translations.
        For reproducibility, clearly citing data sources and providing detailed methodology.
        To enhance equity, I'd advise broadening the scope to include more diverse brands and spending categories, and ensuring a transparent data collection process to minimize biases.
        ```

- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 300 words for each visualization. 

### Why am I doing this assignment?:
- This ongoing assignment ensures active participation in the course, and assesses learning outcomes 2 and 3:  
* Apply general design principles to create accessible and equitable data visualizations
* Use data visualization to tell a story
