# Data Visualization

## Assignment 2: Good and Bad Data Visualization

### Requirements:

- Data visualizations are important tools for communication and convincing; we need to be able to evaluate the ways that data are presented in visual form to be critical consumers of information 
- To test your evaluation skills, locate two public data visualizations online, one good and one bad  
    - You can find data visualizations at https://public.tableau.com/app/discover or https://datavizproject.com/, or anywhere else you like! 
- For each visualization (good and bad):  
    - Explain (with reference to material covered up to date, along with readings and other scholarly sources, as needed) why you classified that visualization the way you did.
      
      Good example:<br>

      The provided treemap is a good example for data visualization best practices due to following reasons:
      - It effectively organizes data hierarchically by sector, making it easy to see which stocks belong to which sectors;
      - The size of each rectangle represents the market capitalization of each stock, providing a visual cue about the relative size of each company within its sector;
      - The use of color effectively communicates performance: green for positive returns, red for negative returns, and varying shades indicating the magnitude of the change. This allows for quick visual assessment of the overall market performance;
      - The treemap maximizes the use of available space, presenting a large amount of data without overwhelming the viewer. This is particularly useful for summarizing the performance of numerous stocks in a compact form;
      - Each sector is clearly labeled, and the largest companies within each sector are easily identifiable by their larger rectangles and prominent labels;
      - The contrasting shades of green and red ensure that even minor performance differences are visible, enhancing the chart's utility for detailed analysis.

      The treemap effectively combines a large volume of data into an accessible and informative visual format, making it easy to compare and contrast the performance of individual stocks and sectors. The clear hierarchical structure, proportional representation, and color coding make it a strong example of good data visualization practices.

      Bad example:<br>

      There are several aspects to support the statement:
      - The chart is overly complex: The 3D elements, numerous labels, and overlapping bars make the chart visually cluttered and hard to interpret quickly;
      - Color choices: The colors are not distinct enough to easily differentiate between categories, especially for those with color vision deficiencies;
      - Labeling and readability: The abundance of labels and small text sizes can be difficult to read and comprehend.<br>

      While the chart is rich in information and visually appealing, its complexity and design choices hinder its effectiveness in conveying data clearly and efficiently. Simplifying the layout, improving color contrast, and making labels more readable could significantly enhance its utility.


    - How could this data visualization have been improved?  
      ```
      For the bad example, which explores how much money was spent by people in each region/country on clothing and technology in 2007, I'd utilize bubble charts to illustrate the relationship between several variables by varying the size of the bubbles. This adds another dimension of data without making the chart too complex. I'd use distinct colors to represent different regions/countries and add labels or tooltips for bubbles to provide additional information (total amount spent, type of spending, etc.). This helps in identifying specific data points easily.
      
      ```
- Word count should not exceed (as a maximum) 500 words for each visualization (i.e. 
300 words for your good example and 500 for your bad example)
